# fine-grained controls for the geometry of the gallery
# each option can have a fixed value, or dynamic by using the following variables:
# ww, wh: mpv window width, mpv window height (always available)
# gx, gy: gallery horizontal position, gallery vertical position
# gw, gh: gallery width, gallery height
# sw, sh: minimum spacing width, minimum spacing height
# tw, th: thumbnail width, thumbnail height
# these strings are interpreted using the lua equivalent of "eval" so math functions and logical conditions can be used
# if an option references variables, they will be computed in the appropriate order
# (for example, if gallery_width == 5 * thumbnail_width, thumbnail_size will be computed before gallery_size)
# in case of cyclical dependencies, the script will abort
# example
# -------
# make the gallery centered
gallery_position={ (ww - gw) / 2, (wh - gh) / 2 }
# make the gallery's size 9/10 the size of the window
gallery_size={ 9 * ww / 10, 9 * wh / 10 }
