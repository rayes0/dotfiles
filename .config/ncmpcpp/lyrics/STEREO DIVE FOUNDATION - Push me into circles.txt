Waiting for you I′m on the other side
Leaving this place Hold on a minute
Take a deep breath Ready to launchCan you see the light of Two divided Rainbow

Not this time I can't believe
You′d better watch yourself rewind your cell
It's moving round and round again and beats
Me like a marching band
Trying to get out from this mess
Only the light can save me Look up in the sky
Don't wanna miss Don′t wanna lose

鮮明に焼きつく軌跡を見上げたその向こうへ
羽ばたいた自由追って色を変えた
Two divided Rainbow

Take you out tonight I′ll be a star so that
We can reach for the sky
Close your eyes and try to realize it's
Time for you to shine I′m coming after you

I see the rocket coming around our orbit
Far from a satellite Adjust the way we go
Let's catch up with the speed of light
Sometimes we need a rest for this long trip
Can you feel the rainbow shines
You gotta feel Tell me you feel

鮮明に焼きつく軌跡を見上げたその向こうへ
羽ばたいた自由追って色を変えた
Two divided Rainbow
