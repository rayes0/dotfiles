Waiting for you I'm on the other side
Leaving this place Hold on a minute
Take a deep breath Ready to launch (Oh !)
Can you see the light of Two Divided Rainbow

Not this time I can't believe
You'd better watch yourself rewind your cell
It's moving round and round and round again and beats me like a marching band
Trying to get out from this mess
Only the light can save me
Look up in the sky
Don't wanna miss (Oh !) Don't wanna lose (Oh !)

Senmei ni yakitsuku kiseki wo miageta sono mukou e
Habataita jiyuu otte iro wo kaeta
Two Divided Rainbow

Take you out tonight I'll be a star so that we can reach for the sky
Close your eyes and try to realize It's time for you to shine
I'm coming after you

I see the rocket coming around our orbit far from a satellite
Adjust the way we go
Let's catch up with the speed of light
Sometimes we need a rest for this long trip
Can you feel the rainbow shines
You gotta feel (Oh !) Tell me you feel (Oh !)

Senmei ni yakitsuku kiseki wo miageta sono mukou e
Habataita jiyuu otte iro wo kaeta
Two Divided Rainbow

Senmei ni yakitsuku kiseki wo miageta sono mukou e
Habataita jiyuu otte iro wo kaeta
