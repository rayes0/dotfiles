Never been here, how about you?
You smile at my answer
Given me the chance
To be held and understood

You leave me laughing without crying
There's no use denying
For many times I've tried
Love has never felt as good

Downtown or way up in the air
When your heart's pounding
You know that I'm aware

You make it easy to watch the world with love
You make it easy to let the past be done
You make it easy

How'd you do it, how'd you find me?
How did I find you ?
How can this be true
To be held and understood?

Keep it coming, no one's running
The lesson I'm learning
Blessings are deserved
By the trust that always could

Downtown or way up in the air
When your heart's pounding
You know that I'm aware

You make it easy to watch the world with love
You make it easy to let the past be done
You make it easy

You make it easy to watch the world with love
You make it easy to let the past be done
You make it easy
So watch me fall in love
