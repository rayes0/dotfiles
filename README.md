<h1 align="center">Dotfiles</h1>

A archival of my personal dotfiles. Take what you need and make sure to do a quick check through the files before you use it and replace my applications with the ones you use (some files are specific to my system).

This is an archival branch, a messy dump for configuration for various things. The [current](https://github.com/rayes0/dotfiles/tree/current) branch contains what I currently use. I merge changes from there into here regularly.
