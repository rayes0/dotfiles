<h1 align="center">~ Dotfiles ~</h1>

This repo contains my personal dotfiles for my own backup purposes. A lot of the files here are specific to my system, and will likely not be compatible with yours right out of the box. I suggest looking at my ![colorscheme repo](https://github.com/rayes0/sayo/) for application themes that will be compatible across the majority of systems.
